# 📊 Demographic Analysis and Life Expectancy Prediction

This project applies machine learning to analyze demographic, health, and socio-economic data in order to predict life expectancy across countries.

## 📌 Objectives
- Explore the relationship between health, economic, and education indicators.
- Cluster countries based on demographic and development features.
- Predict life expectancy using regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).

## 📁 Project Structure
- `data/`: contains raw and processed datasets. ( link src : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/countries-of-the-world-2023/data )
- `src/`: contains the main analysis and modeling script.
- `requirements.txt`: lists all Python dependencies.

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/life_expectancy_analysis.py
